DevDash is a highly configurable terminal dashboard for developers and creators who want to choose and display the most up-to-date metrics they need, at one place.

## Why using DevDash?

* Pull and display the data in nice widgets using YAML (or JSON) config files, from: 
    * Your own computer. From your own scripts and command lines too!
    * A remote computer via SSH.
    * Github.
    * Travis.
    * Google Analytics.
    * Google Search Console.
    * Feedly.

* A lot of flexibility compared to other terminal dashboards:
  * Choose the widgets you want.
  * Place your widgets where you want.
  * Choose the data you want to display, the colors you want to use, and a lot of other things for each widget.
  * Don't want to personalize everything? Don't overwrite the defaults, then.
* Unlimited amount of different dashboards with different configurations.
* Data refreshed automatically via time ticks, or via a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + r by default).

## Installation

You can simply grab the [latest released binary file](https://github.com/Phantas0s/devdash/releases/latest) and download the version you need, depending on your OS.

### Linux script

To download DevDash in `/usr/local/bin`, run the following in a terminal:

```shell
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phantas0s/devdash/master/install/linux.sh | bash
```

### macOS

On macOS, DevDash can also be installed via [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org):

```shell
sudo port install devdash
```

More information [here](https://ports.macports.org/port/devdash/).

### Manual installation

You need to: 
1. Clone this repository 
2. In your terminal, run in the root directory of the project `go build devdash.go`

## Getting started

* If you run `devdash` without giving a dashboard configuration, it will:
    * Create a config for the default dashboard (`default.yml`) in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/devdash`.
    * Display this default dashboard.
* You have [many examples here](https://thedevdash.com/getting-started/examples/) to modify this default dashboard or create your own from scratch.
* Each dashboard need a config file. To pass this config file to DevDash, you need to use the option `-c`. For example: `devdash -c default`.
    * If you only pass the filename of the dashboard's config, it needs to be in the working directory or in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/devdash`.
    * You can also pass a relative or absolute path to the config.
    * The dashboard's config can be written in YAML, JSON, or TOML.

The value of `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` depends of your OS. Here are the defaults (if you didn't modify it):

* **Unix systems**: `~/.config`
* **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support`
* **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%`

## Bugs and Ideas

If you have any idea to improve DevDash or if you see any bug, please open an issue.

## Contribute

Thanks a lot if you want to contribute to DevDash!

If you want to implement a new feature, let's speak about it first (by opening an issue) and decide if it fits DevDash scope.

## Making Of

For anybody interested how I managed to develop DevDash on side of a full time job, and how I organized my time and kept my motivation, [I wrote an article about that on my blog](https://thevaluable.dev/programming-side-project-example-devdash/).
